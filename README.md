## 🧩 **Step-by-Step Breakdown**

---

### ✅ **1. Define Your Project Idea** *(Due: ASAP)*
- **Choose an application type** (or propose your own).
- **Confirm the domain & real-world need**.
- Select **at least two core components** from:  
  - Prompt Engineering  
  - Fine-Tuning  
  - Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)  
  - Multimodal Integration  
  - Synthetic Data Generation  
- *Goal*: Clearly define what your tool will do and who it's for.  
- **Deliverable**: A one-pager draft of your project proposal.

---

### 🧠 **2. Plan Your Architecture & Stack**
- Choose:
  - **LLM(s)**: OpenAI, Mistral, LLaMA, etc.
  - **Tech stack**: LangChain, Unsloth, Streamlit/Flask/React, Pinecone/FAISS
- Design:
  - **System Architecture Diagram** (you’ll reuse this for the PDF and video)
  - **Data flow** for each component (especially if using RAG or fine-tuning)
- **Deliverable**: Draft architecture image + bullet notes.

---

### 📦 **3. Build Core Components**
**Pick any 2 (or more) of the following and execute each fully:**

#### 🔹 A. Prompt Engineering
- Create prompt templates, fallback prompts, and edge-case handling.
- Implement context window management.
- Add chain-of-thought prompting or user flow branching.

#### 🔹 B. Fine-Tuning
- Curate a dataset (public/custom).
- Format in ChatML / instruction-tuned format.
- Fine-tune using Unsloth/HuggingFace.
- Implement eval: BLEU, ROUGE, semantic sim, accuracy.

#### 🔹 C. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
- Chunk documents (token-based or semantic).
- Embed via `HuggingFaceEmbeddings`, store in FAISS/Pinecone.
- Use LangChain for retrieval + generation.
- Implement filters & re-rank logic.

#### 🔹 D. Multimodal Integration
- Upload images/audio/video + LLM response integration.
- Image captioning, OCR, or audio-text fusion.
- Build a front-end that supports cross-modality I/O.

#### 🔹 E. Synthetic Data Generation
- Use GPT to generate high-quality labeled data.
- Augment with paraphrasing, negation, noise injection.
- Show training vs synthetic performance comparison.

### 💻 **4. Build the Interface**
- Use Streamlit or React for your web UI.
- Ensure:
  - Clean UX with clear buttons/workflows.
  - Output quality is high, responsive time is <3 sec.
  - Handle invalid inputs gracefully.

---

### 📂 **5. GitHub Repository Setup**
- Repo structure:
  ```
  /src
  /data
  /docs
  /web
  /models (if lightweight)
  /notebooks (for fine-tuning or EDA)
  README.md
  requirements.txt
  LICENSE
  ```
- Must include:
  - Setup instructions
  - Example inputs/outputs
  - Fine-tuning samples
  - RAG chunks (if used)

---

### 📄 **6. Project Documentation (PDF)**  
Each member submits their own. Include:
- Title, Authors
- Abstract
- System Architecture Diagram
- Component Descriptions (e.g., prompt engine, RAG, etc.)
- Implementation Details
- Performance Metrics
- Challenges + Solutions
- Ethical Considerations (bias, hallucination, copyright)
- Future Work

---

### 📹 **7. Video Demo (10 mins)**  
Must show:
- Live demo (screen + webcam is a bonus)
- Architecture explanation
- Features walkthrough
- Key results & metrics
- Lessons learned  
*Tip: Use OBS + PowerPoint + demo windows.*

---

### 🌐 **8. Web Page**
- Deploy using GitHub Pages / Streamlit Cloud / Vercel
- Include:
  - Title + Description
  - Screenshots or live demo
  - Key features
  - GitHub + PDF links
  - “Try It Now” section (if applicable)
